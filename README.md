# Jonathan Sue's TinyApp Project (Lighthouse Labs)

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). It allows users to register/login and create a personalized list of shortened links that they can use. They can also edit where existing shortlinks point to.
