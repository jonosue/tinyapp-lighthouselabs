# Jonathan Sue's TinyApp Project (Lighthouse Labs)


## Background

This project was completed as part of the Week 2 requirements while I was a student in the Web Development bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. The purpose of this four-day assignment was to build a web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

I was asked to build an HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Along the way I was introduced to some more advanced JavaScript and Node concepts, and I also learned more about Express, a web framework which is very popular in the Node community.

**It is important to note that CSS styling was not an element of this exercise. Visually, it is obviously very plain and poorly laid-out. The purpose of this app was purely to have us work on functionality as opposed to user experience. **


## User Stories

As an avid Twitter poster,
I want to be able to shorten links
so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

As a Twitter reader,
I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links,
so that I can read interesting content.
