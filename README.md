# Jonathan Sue's TinyApp Project (Lighthouse Labs)

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). It allows users to register/login and create a personalized list of shortened links that they can use. They can also edit where existing shortlinks point to.


## User Stories

As an avid Twitter poster,
I want to be able to shorten links
so that I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

As a Twitter reader,
I want to be able to visit sites via shortened links,
so that I can read interesting content.
